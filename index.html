            <p>I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives
                me
                to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that
                helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of
                our
                photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.</p>

                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
